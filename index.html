                <h2>Mobile phones</h2>
        
                <p>
                 I love mobile phones and all the technology around them. That's why last year, I created a little company where I offered my services to repair phones. I used for example to repair Iphone's screens.

                <h2>Parkours</h2>
        
                <p>
                My main student job this year is to help college students to do their homework. I do this thanks to Parkours. It's a company that hires young students that are 18-25 years old. They locate some classrooms to a college. Then, students of this college pay Parkours every week a certain price and can come on monday, tuesday, thursday and friday. They are divided, in different classes, with other students of the same class and a tutor. There is one tutor by class. I have a classe of secondes this year. This experience teach me many things : I learn everyday how to be more pedagogic. Furthermore, I learn how to make them work, how to make them enjoy working. It is also easier for them to learn from someone closed to their age and with some common centers of interest.

                <h2>Alcoool</h2>
                    <p>
                        My second job this year is to be an Alcoool ambassador. It consists in promoting this new French brand and executing a few missions they ask me to do. For example, I have to visit at least 4 pharmacies a month to form them about how to sell well our product to customers.
